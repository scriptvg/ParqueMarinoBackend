# PayPal Integration Tests - COMPLETED

## Task Status
✅ **COMPLETED**: Created comprehensive tests for PayPal integration

## What Was Done

### 1. Fixed Existing Test Issues
- Removed incorrect pytest imports that were causing test failures
- Corrected test method signatures to match the actual PayPalClient implementation
- Fixed parameter passing to match the PayPalClient methods
- Removed tests for methods that don't exist in the PayPalClient class

### 2. Created Comprehensive Test Coverage
Created 8 comprehensive tests covering all PayPal functionality:

1. **test_create_payment_success** - Tests successful payment creation
2. **test_create_payment_failure** - Tests error handling for payment creation failures
3. **test_execute_payment_success** - Tests successful payment execution
4. **test_execute_payment_failure** - Tests error handling for payment execution failures
5. **test_refund_payment_success** - Tests successful payment refund
6. **test_refund_payment_failure** - Tests error handling for refund failures
7. **test_refund_payment_full_amount** - Tests refund for full payment amount
8. **test_paypal_error_inheritance** - Tests PayPalError class inheritance

### 3. Proper Test Configuration
- Added proper Django test settings using @override_settings decorator
- Configured all required PayPal settings for testing:
  - PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID
  - PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
  - PAYPAL_SANDBOX
  - PAYPAL_RETURN_URL
  - PAYPAL_CANCEL_URL

### 4. Effective Mocking Strategy
- Used unittest.mock to properly mock all external PayPal API calls
- Mocked paypalrestsdk.Payment for payment creation and execution tests
- Mocked paypalrestsdk.Sale for refund tests
- Simulated both success and failure scenarios for complete coverage

### 5. Test Results
All 8 PayPal tests are passing successfully:
- ✅ Payment creation (success and failure cases)
- ✅ Payment execution (success and failure cases)
- ✅ Payment refund (success and failure cases)
- ✅ Error handling and exception raising
- ✅ Class inheritance verification

## Test Execution
The tests can be run with:
```bash
python manage.py test payments.tests.test_paypal.TestPayPalClient
```

## Integration Status
The PayPal tests integrate properly with the existing Django test framework and provide complete coverage of the PayPal integration functionality.
