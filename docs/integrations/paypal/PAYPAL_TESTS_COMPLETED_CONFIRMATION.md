## What Was Accomplished

1. **Created comprehensive test coverage** for all PayPal functionality:
   - Payment creation (success and failure scenarios)
   - Payment execution (success and failure scenarios)
   - Payment refunds (success, failure, and full amount scenarios)
   - Error handling and exception raising
   - Class inheritance verification

2. **Fixed existing test issues**:
   - Removed pytest imports that were causing conflicts
   - Corrected test method signatures to match actual implementation
   - Fixed parameter passing issues
   - Removed tests for non-existent methods

3. **Proper test configuration**:
   - Used Django's @override_settings decorator for test configurations
   - Implemented proper mocking of external PayPal API calls
   - Configured all required PayPal settings for testing

## Test Coverage

The tests verify both success and failure scenarios for all PayPal operations:
- Payment creation and validation
- Payment execution and confirmation
- Refund processing
- Error handling for various failure cases
- Proper exception raising with correct error messages
- Class inheritance from APIException

## Integration Status

The PayPal integration tests now work seamlessly with the Django testing framework and provide complete coverage of the PayPal integration functionality.
