### What Was Done
1. **Fixed Existing Test Issues**

     - Payment Refund (success, failure, and full amount cases)
     - Error Handling and Exception Raising
     - Class Inheritance Verification

3. **Proper Configuration**
   - Added Django test settings with @override_settings decorator
   - Configured all required PayPal test settings (client ID, secret, URLs)
   - Used unittest.mock for effective API call mocking

4. **Test Results**
   - All 8 PayPal tests are passing successfully!

## Fixes to Other Test Files
