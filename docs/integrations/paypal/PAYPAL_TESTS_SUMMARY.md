## Test Configuration
The tests use Django's override_settings decorator to provide test values for:
- PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID
- PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
- PAYPAL_SANDBOX
- PAYPAL_RETURN_URL
- PAYPAL_CANCEL_URL

## Mocking Strategy
All external PayPal API calls are properly mocked using unittest.mock:
- paypalrestsdk.Payment is mocked for payment creation and execution tests
- paypalrestsdk.Sale is mocked for refund tests
- All API responses are simulated to test both success and failure scenarios

## Test Results
All 8 tests are passing successfully, covering the complete PayPal integration functionality including:
- Payment creation
- Payment execution
- Payment refund
- Error handling
